I am currently enrolled in the [Turing School of Software and
Design](http://www.turing.io) learning Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. In a
previous life, I was an Investment Research Associate for a Wealth Management
firm based in Denver, CO.

Originally from North Carolina, I moved to Denver in 2013 after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with an undergraduate finance degree. Not long after I started programming in my spare time and later heard about Turing and quickly made the leap into Web Application development. I hope to work for a team that encourages the development of junior developers and emphasizes continual learning so I can continue my rapid trajectory.

I hope this blog can be a resource to those who are on the fence about jumping
into Web Development as well as provide a few tips and tricks to those just
starting out.
