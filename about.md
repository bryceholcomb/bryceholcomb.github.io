I am currently enrolled in the [Turing School of Software and
Design](http://www.turing.io) learning Ruby on Rails and Javascript. In a
previous life, I was an Investment Research Associate for a Wealth Management
firm based in Denver, CO.

I hope this blog can be a resource to those who are on the fence about jumping
into Web Development as well as provide a few tips and tricks to those just
starting out.
