summary: "Beyond the Basics"
---
As I wrote my first blog post on how I got to where I am today, a student at the
[Turing School of Software and Design](http://www.turing.io), I began realizing
that the how isn't as important as the why.

I came to Turing to learn beyond just the basics of web development, and a few
of my goals are:

- Learn to develop on a team
- Give back to the community

If you want to know the plethora of reasons why I chose Turing in particular, feel free to shoot me an
email.

### Teamwork

I am very excited to work with my fellow students at Turing. We have a very
diverse group from all different backgrounds, but with one goal of becoming Ruby
on Rails developers. During my time at Turing I hope to learn how to effectively
work within a team. As most of our projects with be with either a pair or groups
of up to four or five, I am sure I will have many opportunities to work on this
skill.

I have been programming in my spare time for a few months now, but only with
tutorials or on my own solo projects. I can only imagine what the dynamics are when
you add multiple other programmers to the same project. I have spent a little
time with git and Github, and I am excited to see how these tools can be managed
to create a seamless workflow, or as close to seamless as possible.

The industry seems to be moving more and more towards pair programming and I
couldn't be happier. For me, as a soon to be junior developer, that means I get
to work along side seasoned veterans and soak up all their knowledge. More
seriously, through the first few weeks of Turing, I have found that the quality
of my code is exponentially better when working with a pair. I hope to continue
to work on the communication and other soft skills that make pair programming
such a worthwhile practice.

### Giving Back

I have been incredibly fortunate to be welcomed into the tech community here in
Denver both through my time before Turing going to meetups, and now that I am a full
time student of web development. I have also saved many hours of my life by
finding incredible open source projects that filled a need in a project, and not
to mention the fact that Rails is open source.

I would love the opportunity to
give back to this local community and the tech community at large. Whether it is
speaking at meetups or making open source contributions, I hope to learn all
my options for giving back and how to go about them while at Turing.

### Moving Forward

As I move through the seven month program, I hope to revisit these learning goals and
provide updates on my progress. In the meantime, stay tuned!
