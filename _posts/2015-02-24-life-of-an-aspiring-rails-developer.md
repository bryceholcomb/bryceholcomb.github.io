summary: "It has its ups and downs"
---
One of the funnier and subtler lines in the movie Mr. Deeds is a scene where
Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) enters an elevator with an operator. The lengthy
dialogue follows with:

**Longfellow Deeds**: "So how is the elevator business treating you, Reuben?"

**Reuben the elevator operator**: "Oh, it has its ups and downs."

I feel like this summarizes the life of an aspiring Rails developer and software
developing in general quite well. As you progress and learn more about Rails
sometimes there are more ups than downs. I've heard it said many times, "The
more you learn, the more you learn how little you know".

It is easy to get discouraged, especially since I am in a seven month program at
the [Turing School of Software and Design](http://www.turing.io). As time goes
by, I find more and more aspects of Ruby, Rails and Javascript that I want to
explore, but the time constraint is a very harsh reality. In the wake of this I
am trying to keep a postive attitude in thinking back on just how much I've
learned. With that in mind, it is easy to see that there have been far more ups
than downs on my journey to becomming a Rails developer.
