title:  "RiderDemand"
live_url: https://rider-demand.herokuapp.com
code: https://github.com/bryceholcomb/rider_demand
stack: Ruby on Rails, Uber API, Eventful API, MapBox.js, PostgreSQL
summary: "An individual project built while a student at the Turing School of Software and Design. The focus was on consuming and building APIs."
---
- Consuming multiple APIs and testing with VCR
- Building an API
- AJAX/jQuery to make the map and content filtering a single-page
- Proper ENV variable management with Figaro
- Continuous integration and deployment with Codeship
- PivotalTracker (albeit with an individual project)

#### Next Steps

- Wrap the current JSON endpoints in a more formal API with authentication
- Develop a mobile application that renders the RiderDemand API data
- Integrate Sidekiq and Redis to update Uber ETA times every five minutes
